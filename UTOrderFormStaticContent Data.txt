<br/>
<p style="columns:2;">4.10.</p>

<p style="columns:2;">4.11.</p> 
<p style="columns:2;"><b>Acceptance of Instructions:</b> The Client acknowledges that any Fund Representative or Fund which receives any order in relation to the relevant Fund from the Bank is not obliged to accept the order in part or whole.

The Client acknowledges and agrees that the Bank’s (or the Custodian’s) responsibility is solely to implement the instructions of the Client given subject to this Agreement.</p>
<br/>
<p style="columns:2;">4.12.</p> 
<p style="columns:2;"><b>Transfer:</b> Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement, the transfer of any Investments shall be subject to the prior approval of the Bank and on such terms as the Bank may specify including but not limited to the terms herein and the terms attached to the applicable transfer form provided always that the Bank shall not be liable to arrange the transfer of any Investments until all the Client’s liabilities to the Bank under this Agreement (including any outstanding fees and expenses payable under this Agreement) shall have been fully discharged.</p>
<br/>
<p style="columns:2;">4.13.</p>

If no instructions are received within the time specified for receipt of the same and/or a satisfactory course of action cannot be agreed with the relevant Fund Representative within any time period specified for this purpose, the Bank shall redeem, or shall procure the Custodian to redeem, the relevant Investments and pay the proceeds to the Client in accordance with Clause 4.7.</p>
<br/>
<p style="columns:2;">4.14.</p> 
<p style="columns:2;"><b>Regular Investment Scheme:</b> If the Client wishes to participate in any Regular Investment Scheme (<b>“RIS”</b>) offered by the Bank for any of the Funds, the Client shall instruct the Bank to place on its behalf an application to purchase Investments under such RIS with the appropriate relevant Fund Representatives (<b>“RIS Application”</b>). To participate in the RIS for a Fund, the Client is required to: (i) participate for a minimum of 6 consecutive months; and (ii) have an existing holding in the Fund or a minimum initial investment of S$1000 in the Fund. The provisions of this Clause 4.14 shall apply mutatis mutandis to any Investments acquired by the Client under such RIS.
The Client may apply for the prevailing amount invested by him/her under the RIS to be increased (<b>“RIS increment application”</b>). This increment must be in multiples of $10 (<b>“Increment”</b>). However, the increased amount to be invested will only apply from the date falling one year from the date the RIS increment application is approved (<b>“Increment Date”</b>). Thereafter, on each anniversary of the Increment Date, the amount to be invested by the Client under the RIS will automatically increase by the Increment. No further authorisation or approval from the Client is required for such automatic increase.
For RIS Applications approved (or as the case may be, for Increment Dates, and their anniversaries which fall):<br>
(i) before the 15th of the month: the monthly deduction for the RIS will be done two (2) working days before the 25th of the same month, and subsequent monthly deductions will be done two (2) working days before the 25th of each following month;<br>
(ii) after the 15th of the month: the monthly deduction for the RIS will be done two (2) working days before the 25th of the following month, and subsequent monthly deductions will be done on the two (2) working days before the 25th of each following month.<br>
Under the RIS, monies will be automatically deducted from the Client’s nominated debiting account or charged to the Client’s nominated credit card account. Therefore, the Client must ensure that the nominated debiting account has sufficient funds to meet the necessary payment or that the Client’s nominated credit card account shall not by virtue of this transaction exceed the credit limit of that nominated credit card account.<br>
The purchase of Investments will not be executed if any payment deductions are unsuccessful. If there are two (2) consecutive unsuccessful deductions from the nominated debiting account or credit card for RIS, UOB reserves the right to terminate the RIS arrangement without further notice to the Client.<br>
The Client must give at least thirty (30) days’ notice in writing to the Bank to terminate or change any instruction to purchase Investments on its behalf under any RIS. The Bank reserves the right to impose such conditions or restrictions on termination or change of such RIS, as it deems fit.<br>
If the Client submits amendments or changes to the details for an existing RIS arrangement for a Fund (<b>“New Arrangement”</b>), the New Arrangement will automatically prevail and override the existing RIS arrangement for that Fund. Please provide the relevant account details in the Investment Application Form to allow for RIS settlement via direct debit, credit card, CPF or SRS.</p>

(b) the Client is an existing participant in the Fund and the Purchase Agreement is the Client’s second or subsequent Purchase Agreement in respect of such Fund unless such Purchase Agreement (other than one resulting from a switch of Investments) was entered into by the Client within the Cancellation Period of the Client’s first Purchase Agreement in respect of such Fund;<br>
(c) the Client switches Investments; or<br>
(d) the Client participates in a Regular Investment Scheme, making a second or any subsequent payment for Investments.</p>
<br/>
<p style="columns:2;">6.2.</p> 
<p style="columns:2;">Each Cancellation Request must be made within the Cancellation Period to the Bank. The Cancellation Request is subject to the provisions of the Prospectus and Trust Deed of the relevant Fund. A Cancellation Request may either be delivered in person or sent by post to the Bank. In the case where the Cancellation Request is sent by post, the relevant date for determining whether the Client has exercised the right to cancel within the Cancellation Period shall be the date of the postmark or such other reasonable means as may be determined by the Bank and permitted by Applicable Laws. The Client hereby authorises the Bank to deliver such Cancellation Request, or otherwise communicate its contents, to the relevant Fund Representative (whether in the name of the Client or in the name of the Bank, and whether in the same form or in such other form, as the Bank deems fit in each case in the Bank’s sole and absolute discretion).</p>
<br/>
<p style="columns:2;">6.3.</p> 
<p style="columns:2;">A Cancellation Request must be made by the Client by way of such form as the Bank may from time to time prescribe in the Bank’s sole and absolute discretion.</p>

(b) where a Cancellation Request, whether delivered in person or sent by post to the Bank or otherwise, is received after 12.30 pm on any Dealing Day of a Fund, the dealing price of Investments of that Fund on the next Dealing Day; or<br>
(c) for new Funds where the subscription monies have not been invested, the initial offer price of the Fund.</p>
<br/>
<p style="columns:2;">6.6.</p> 
<p style="columns:2;">Subject to Clauses 6.6. and 6.7., the relevant provisions of the Prospectus and Trust Deed of the Fund, and the cancellation procedures of the relevant Fund, the amount to be refunded to the Client (the <b>“Cancellation Proceeds”</b>) pursuant to a Cancellation Request, if accepted, shall be calculated as follows:<br>
(a) where a Cancellation Request, whether delivered in person or sent by post to the Bank or otherwise, is received by 12.30 pm on any Dealing Day of a Fund, the dealing price of Investments of that Fund on that Dealing Day;<br>

(c) for new Funds where the subscription monies have not been invested, the initial offer price of the Fund.</p>
<br/>
<p style="columns:2;">6.7.</p> 
<p style="columns:2;">The Client acknowledges that the Bank and/or the Fund Representative shall, in determining the Cancellation Proceeds payable, be entitled to an adjustment to reflect the change in market value of the Investments held by the Client. In the event the market value of the Investments held by the Client is greater than the original amount paid by the Client under the Purchase Agreement, the Fund Representative shall be entitled to retain such excess amount in the Fund.</p>
<br/>
<p style="columns:2;">6.8.</p> 
<p style="columns:2;">Where payment has been made for the relevant Purchase Agreement, the Client shall receive the Cancellation Proceeds in accordance with the Code on Collective Investments Schemes in respect of payment of redemption proceeds, subject to such modifications by any exemptions as may be allowed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore.</p>
<br/>
<p style="columns:2;">6.9.</p> 
<p style="columns:2;">The Client acknowledges that where payment for the Investments is made using CPF or SRS monies, the Cancellation Proceeds will be refunded to the relevant CPF or SRS account(s) only upon receipt of the subscription monies by the Fund Representative from the relevant CPF agent bank, the CPF Board or the SRS operator.</p>
<br/>
<p style="columns:2;">6.10.</p> 
<p style="columns:2;">In the event that CPF or SRS monies are used for Investments, the following costs may be incurred when the right to cancel the Purchase Agreement is exercised:<br>

<br/>
<p style="columns:2;">6.11.</p> 
<p style="columns:2;">The Client acknowledges that the Fund Representative shall have the right to suspend any Cancellation Request during any period when the right of holders of Investments in any Fund to require redemption is suspended pursuant to the relevant provisions of the Prospectus and Trust Deed of the Fund. The number of Investments which may be cancelled and realised is at all times subject to the limit on realisation as provided in the Prospectus and Trust Deed of the relevant Fund.</p>
<br/>
<p style="columns:2;">6.12.</p> 
<p style="columns:2;">During the Cancellation Period and where Investments in a Fund may be redeemed, the Client may choose to redeem its Investments in the Fund instead of exercising its right to cancel the Investments. Where the Client elects to redeem its Investments in the Fund, the redemption procedures as stated in the Prospectus of the relevant Fund shall apply and the Client will not enjoy the benefits of cancellation. The redemption proceeds that the Client will receive may be lower than the amount being refunded had it exercised its cancellation right if the appreciation in the value of Investments in the Fund is less than the initial sales charge. The Client acknowledges that the published prices are indicative in nature and may change during the period between the submission and processing of the redemption request.</p>
<br/>
<p style="columns:2;">6.13.</p> 
<p style="columns:2;">Unless permitted by the relevant Purchase Agreement, during the Cancellation Period, the Client shall not be entitled to switch its Investments in a Fund for Investments in other Funds managed by the same Fund Representative.

(a) the Client will not receive any refund of the initial sales charge paid in relation to the Purchase Agreement in respect of the original Fund;<br>
(b) it is not certain whether the Client would be in a better or worse position if the Client switches Investments;<br>
(c) the Client will be liable for any charges or fees involved in the switch; and<br>
(d) the Client will be entitled to the right to cancel the Investments in the other Fund (the “Switched Fund”) provided the Client satisfies the conditions of the cancellation policy applicable to the Switched Fund.</p>
